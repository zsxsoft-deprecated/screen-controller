MyScreen
================

a node.js app to control fzbz screen.

As we know, the activities in schools are always SHITFUL. My school is Fuzhou No.8 Middle School, and it has a large screen. In order to let the next activity perfect, I write this app to control the screen.

This project is written by node.js. With the help of HTML5 socket.io, I can throw AJAX Polling away! But I didn't use other features, like Canvas. It's regret. In the other hand, it's enough as a app that developed only for 24 hours......
